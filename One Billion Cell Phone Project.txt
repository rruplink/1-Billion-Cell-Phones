Introduction
Our project is called 1 billion cell phones. It has the goal of using micro-loans, gifts, and infrastructure support to bring cell phones to every single person over the age of 14 in the world.


Our Principles
Tech-Empowered - We are not just a technology charity, but a technical one as well. We are committed to maximizing efficiency and return for every dollar spent, and we regard technology and investment in systemization as the best way to achieve this.
Data-Driven - We are driven towards constant refinement with data. Data collection and analysis allows us to systemize, streamline, and refine every process and procedure involved in our operations - all to continually improve our outcomes.
Radically-Transparent - We are committed towards total transparency, not only in terms of results but also in terms of strategy. With constant data collection and built-in systems, we believe we can offer our supporters incredible insight into our operations.






Our Why
Economic Empowerment - Provides access to banking, financial services, and digital marketplaces, enabling economic mobility and independence.
Healthcare Access - Enables telemedicine, health information, medication reminders, and emergency services in underserved areas.
Educational Opportunity - Creates pathways to learning resources, courses, and AI-powered educational tools regardless of location.
Women's & Minority Empowerment - Gives marginalized groups tools to network, organize, access resources, and escape dangerous situations.
Crisis Response - Provides critical communication channels during disasters and emergencies for alerts and coordinating assistance.
Agricultural Improvement - Gives farmers access to weather data, market prices, and best practices that can dramatically improve yields and income.
Digital Identity - Offers a platform for the estimated 1 billion people without official identification to establish digital identity.
Entrepreneurship Development - Enables small business creation with minimal capital investment, particularly in developing economies.


Our How
Our Techniques
Micro-Loans - Providing accessible micro-financing options to individuals and small businesses to purchase affordable devices with manageable repayment structures.
Targeted Gifts - Distributing devices to those most in need through carefully vetted programs that ensure technology reaches people who would benefit most.
Infrastructure - Partnering with telecommunication companies to expand networks into underserved areas and reduce connectivity costs.
Digital Literacy - Implementing education programs to ensure recipients can effectively use their devices to access services and opportunities.
Local Partnerships - Working with local organizations to ensure cultural appropriateness and sustainability of our initiatives.
Global Strategy - Developing region-specific approaches that address unique challenges while maintaining our core mission and values.


Our Implementation Strategy
Specific Localities - To begin with, we intend to select a key locality in a handpicked region. As opposed to conventional internet access projects - which tend to focus on ‘wide’ distribution generally involving providing a handful of laptops or phones to a community at large - we want to focus on depth. In other words, concentrating on getting cell phones into the hands of the majority of a community. We believe in this strategy for a handful of reasons covered in the Localities section below.
Regional Expansion - Once critical mass of cellphone rollout has been achieved in our targeted locality, we then expand our reach to target surrounding communities. By focusing on regional metropolitan areas and then working outward into more isolated villages, we create a regional rising tide that makes our operations radically simple, proffers the most benefit, and encourages private adoption.
Scaling Upwards - After proof of concept has been achieved in a specific region, we intend to rapidly scale up our locality strategy by launching simultaneously in many other localities located in proximity to our chosen one - growing outward from this centre to continue to enhance the network benefits discussed below.
Global Partnerships - All throughout this process we hope to develop deep links with partners in industry and governance across the globe. From simplifying operations to cost reduction - building relationships with key actors in this space is essential to our strategy.


Localities Strategy
Private Ownerships Benefits - We believe that the most coherent benefits from cell phones emerge from private ownership. Entrepreneurship, economic formalization, and educational opportunities are greatly enhanced by continual, individual access to the internet and community-based solutions simply can’t offer the same suite of benefits.
Network Effects - The more individual cell phone owners there are in a particular community, the greater the benefits to both individuals and the community at large of cell phone ownership. So many benefits of smartphones (economic empowerment and formalization, especially) rely on scale of access locally.
Selecting Localities - We will factor in economic links, current rate of smartphone ownership, internet/telecom availability, and ease of operations when selecting the region we wish to operate in.






Our Roadmap
2025 - Create initial plan, file for formation, find international partners, and determine the first region we will begin operations in.
2026 - Begin with a micro-launch to field-test methodologies and strategies. Begin to develop proof of concept.
2027 - Launch full-scale proof of concept project in selected locality. Develop case study and full proof of concept.
2028 - Use proof of concept to acquire further funding and access. Determine a growth plan based on what we've learned and begin to execute.
